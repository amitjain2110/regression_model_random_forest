Business Objective

Predict Motor Speed & temperature based on other attributes available

Data Set Details:
A comprehensive csv files containing all measurement sessions and features. Each row represents one snapshot of sensor data at a certain time step. Sample rate is 2 Hz (One row per 0.5 seconds). Distinctive sessions are identified with "profile_id".

Feature set:

ambient

Ambient temperature as measured by a thermal sensor located closely to the stator.

coolant

Coolant temperature. The motor is water cooled. Measurement is taken at outflow.

u_d

Voltage d-component

u_q

Voltage q-component motor_speed

Motor speed

torque

Torque induced by current.

i_d

Current d-component

i_q

Current q-component

pm

Permanent Magnet surface temperature representing the rotor temperature. This was measured with an infrared thermography unit.

stator_yoke

Stator yoke temperature measured with a thermal sensor.

stator_tooth

Stator tooth temperature measured with a thermal sensor.

stator_winding

Stator winding temperature measured with a thermal sensor.
